Hello All! I'm Nagesh Bhimari, I'm started learning Pytorch
# PyTorch
PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning that's commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing.
Written in Python, it's relatively easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use. coming to the machine learning & Deep Learning
1) Machine Learning is turning things(data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.
2) Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
 Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions.
Deep Learning is useful for the situations like:
1) Problems with long lists of rules
2) deep learning  can adapt learn new different environments
3) Discovering insights with large amount of data
Deep Learning not useful for these situations like:
1) When the traditional approach is better option
2) when errors are unacceptable
3) when we need explainability approach
